The NSIS installer scripts in this folder reference some files that are not
included in the repository for required for running fwbackups on Windows.

In order to create the proper directory structure, create two folders named
"git" and "installers". Inside the git folder, fwbackups from the repository.
For example:
devel\git\fwbackups
devel\installers

== MSI/EXE installers ==
Download the latest version of Python, and pycron (32-bit) at the URLs below:
Python: http://www.python.org/
PyCron: http://www.kalab.com/freeware/pycron/pycron.htm

== GTK Runtime Environment ==

Now, inside the installers folder create a new folder named "gtkfiles". In this
folder you will need to extract the latest all-in-one GTK+ runtime package,
available from the GTK+ download page for Windows:
http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html

Although not strictly required, it is recommended that you clean out unneeded
developer files (for example, the HTML documentation, man pages, pkgconfig
files, and executables in the "bin" folder among others).

The installers\gtkfiles should now contain folders "bin", "etc", "share" and so
on. GTK+ runtime does not include the glade library so both it and its
dependency, libxml2, must be downloaded from the GNOME website:
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/libglade/
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/dependencies/

Create an "addon" folder inside installers\gtkfiles and extract both
libglade-2.0-0.dll and libxml2-2.dll there.

== Python Modules ==
Create a folder "pythonmodules" inside the installers folder and extract* (ie,
using 7-Zip) the python modules from the binary executables into this
folder.

PyGTK: http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/
PyGObject: http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/
PyCairo: http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/
PyWin32: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

== Cryptography Python Modules ==
Create a folder "pythonmodules-restricted" inside the installers folder and
extract* the python modules from the binary executables into this folder.

* Note that in many cases fwbackups does not require the complete contents of a
given Python module to function correctly. In fact, for PyWin32 only a small
subset of the module is required. If you wish to clean up these unneeded
components, I recommend running Py2Exe in order to determine which files and/or
DLLs are required.
