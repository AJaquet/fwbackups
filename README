== Preface ==
A copy of the user guide is available in HTML and PDF form in the docs/ folder
included with this download of fwbackups.

The most recent documentation, both user guides and installation tutorials, are
available at the following URL:
http://www.diffingo.com/oss/fwbackups/documentation

If possible it is recommended that you follow the instructions there since they
will be the most up-to-date and will contain any corrections necessary.

== Binary Packages ==
Most distributions offer package management systems that make it extremely easy
to install additional software packages. If your distribution offers fwbackups
in its software repositories, it is recommended you install fwbackups that way
instead.

At the time of writing, fwbackups is known to have deb packages available for
Ubuntu Linux as well as RPM packages for Fedora Linux and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux. If a distribution that has packages for fwbackups is not listed here,
please contact Stewart Adam <s.adam@diffingo.com>.

  === Ubuntu Linux ===
  fwbackups has been submitted for review at REVU and will hopefully be included
  in the main Ubuntu repositories soon. When it becomes available, it can be
  installed through the "Synaptics Package Manager" tool under the "System >
  Administration" menu.
  
  In the mean time, please obtain the packages directly from Magne Nordtveit's PPA
  on Launchpad.net: https://launchpad.net/~magne-nordtveit/+archive/ppa/+packages
  
  32bit: Download & open 'fwbackups_1.43.3rc4-0ubuntu1~ppa5_i386.deb'
  64bit: Download & open 'fwbackups_1.43.3rc4-0ubuntu1~ppa5_amd64.deb'


  === Fedora Linux ===
  fwbackups is available from the Fedora repositories. From the "System" menu
  select "Administration > Add/Remove Software" tool and search for "fwbackups".
  Selecting the checkbox next to its name and clicking "Apply" will install it.
  
  Alternatively, you may type in a terminal:
    $ su -c 'yum install fwbackups'
  Provide the root password when prompted.

== Installing form source ==
If no packages are readily available for your distribution, then you will have
build and install fwbackups from source.

Be prepared to use a terminal - in most Gnome-based distributions, a terminal
application can be found in the "Applications > System Tools" menu.

  === Dependencies ===
  Before starting, please ensure you have installed the following dependencies:
  - automake
  - autoconf
  - gettext
  - python
  - any cron service (dcron, vixie-cron or cronie for example)
  - pygtk (including libglade support)
  - pycrypto (often callled python-crypto)
  - paramiko (often called python-paramiko)
  - Optional: libnotify bindings for Python (often called python-notify)
  
  Note: For most distributions, it is safe to assume that Python and a cron
  service are installed by default.
  
  
  === Building & installing fwbackups ===
  To build a stable or testing release, run the following in a terminal:
    $ cd fwbackups-VERSIONHERE
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $ make
    $ su -c 'make install'
  Provide the root password when prompted, and replace VERSIONHERE with the
  version of fwbackups you have downloaded.
  
  Note: if you are installing a development version of fwbackups (directly from
  the git repository), then you will need to run "./autogen.sh" before executing
  any of the commands above. If you're not sure what this means, it's safe to
  ignore it.
  
  === Running fwbackups ===
  fwbackups should now appear in the "Applications > System Tools" menu.
  Alternatively, you may start it directly from a terminal session by running:
    $ fwbackups

  === UNINSTALLING ===
  (If you have installed fwbackups from source, uninstalling it requires that you
  keep the original source directory you built fwbackups in)
    $ cd fwbackups-VERSIONHERE
    $ su -c "make uninstall"

== Advanced usage ==
  $ fwbackups
The administor, a GUI tool to manage sets or perform one-time backups
and restore operations.

  $ fwbackups-run SetName(s)
