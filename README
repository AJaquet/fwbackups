-- FAQ --
  Q: Why won't it start in Windows?
  A: Please ensure you have a valid GTK+ installation. Any other errors are
     reported through a graphical interface (which requires GTK+)

  Q: Why can't you just include paramiko and pycrypto in the installer?
  A: Because of export restrictions on cryptographic software, they can't be
     included in the installer.
