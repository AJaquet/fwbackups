== In General ==
- Disk space checks when restoring/backing up
- File System restores files to their original location... But on Windows?
- Check permissions in testConnection()
- When performing a backup, close previous notifications. This way, we don't
  have two open at once if an error occurs early on
- Fix the cross-os uploading / problem
--> happens on return sftp.put(src, os.path.join(dst, os.path.basename(src)) )
    in sftp.py

== Ideas for later ==
- Possibility of interactive mode, when set to False disables -v for speedups
- Perserve permissions on receiving folder?
- Split the overlapping parts of operations/* into engines/*
- CLI restore app
- SSH public key authentication
