== In General ==
- Disk space checks when restoring/backing up
- File System will restore to their original location... How to do this on Windows?
- Check permissions in testConnection()
- When performing a backup, close previous notifications. This way, we don't
  have two open at once if an error occurs early on
- Niceness for restores (requires to set niceness on own process)
- Real progressbar for operations  (not just pulsing)
- SSH public key authentication
- CLI restore app

== Before rc2 ==
- File excludes when uploading directly to SFTP? (can't use os.walk)

== Before rc3 ==
- Don't crash if we don't have paramiko; just disable the remote features
- Support for remote folders (restore)
- Split the overlapping parts of operations/* into engines/*
