== In General ==
- Disk space checks when restoring/backing up
- File System will restore to their original location... How to do this on Windows?
- Check permissions in testConnection()
- When performing a backup, close previous notifications. This way, we don't
  have two open at once if an error occurs early on
- SSH public key authentication
- CLI restore app

== Before 1.43.3 final ==
- Update documentation
