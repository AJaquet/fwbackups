The documentation for fwbackups is written in DocBook XML and uses the Publican
publishing tool: https://fedorahosted.org/publican/

Please note that you no longer need to build the documentation yourself.
Rendered HTML and PDF copies of the user guide can be found in the html/, and
pdf/ folders respectively (the single-page version of the user guide is named
index-single.html).

If you wish to build the documentation from scratch anyways, you will need to
obtain Publican and install the diffingo brand:
  $ cd publican-diffingo
  $ publican install_brand --path=/usr/share/publican/Common_Content

Systems using the RPM package manager can alternatively generate a RPM package:
  $ cd publican-diffingo
  $ publican --package --binary

Once the diffingo brand has been installed, run the 'build.sh' script in the
User_Guide/ folder to build the documentation. The rendered HTML and PDF files
will be output to the 'User_Guide/tmp" folder.
