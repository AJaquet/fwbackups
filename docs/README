The documentation for fwbackups is written in DocBook XML and uses the Publican
publishing tool: https://fedorahosted.org/publican/

Please note that as of 1.43.3rc5, you no longer need to build the documentation
yourself. Rendered HTML and PDF copies of the user guide can be found in the
html/, and pdf/ folders respectively (the single-page version of the user guide
is named index-single.html).

If you wish to build the documentation from scratch anyways, you will need to
obtain Pelican and install the diffingo brand, contained in the
publican-diffingo/ folder.  Once the diffingo brand has been installed, run
'build.sh' script in the User_Guide/ folder to build the documentation. The
rendered HTML and PDF files will be output to the 'User_Guide/tmp" folder.
