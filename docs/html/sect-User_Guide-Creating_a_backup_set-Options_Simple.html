				The <span class="guilabel"><strong>Options (Simple)</strong></span> tab allows you to set the parameters for your backup. In addition, the options tabs allow you to you select the backup format and the number of old backups to keep at any given time.
			</div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Backup Format</span></dt><dd><div class="para">
							Your backup will be stored differently differently depending on the backup format selected (this option replaces the <span class="guilabel"><strong>Backup Engine</strong></span> selection in versions 1.43.2 and earlier).
						</div><div class="para">
							An <span class="guilabel"><strong>Archive</strong></span> backup packs all of the files into a single (often large) "tar" archive file. Unfortunately, Archive backups do not support incremental backups; a full snapshot must be created each time. Archive backups support both gzip and bzip2 on-the-fly compression. This backup format was formerly called the "tar" backup engine (".gz" or ".bz2" was appended if gzip or bzip2 compression was enabled, respectively). 
							<div class="note"><h2>Reducing backup size with compression</h2><div class="para">
									Enabling compression will utilize more system resources during the backup, but results in smaller file sizes. <span class="emphasis"><em>gzip</em></span> is a relatively lightweight compression with a good compression ratio. If you would like to further reduce the size of your backups, consider switching to <span class="emphasis"><em>bzip2</em></span> compression. Although it is much slower than gzip, bzip2 is able to achieve smaller file sizes.
								</div></div>

						</div><div class="para">
							A <span class="guilabel"><strong>Direct copy</strong></span> backup will simply copy your files and their folder structure as-is, similar to a drag-and-drop copy in your file browser. Although this backup type does not support compression, incremental backups are available. This backup format was formerly called the "rsync" backup engine. 
							<div class="note"><h2>Increasing backup speed</h2><div class="para">
									Enabling the <span class="guibutton"><strong>Backups are incremental</strong></span> option will run an incremental backup instead of a full one, copying only the changes since your last backup. Currently, the incremental backups are only available for set backups on Unix-like platforms (such as Linux and OS X) and cannot be used when backing up to a remote host.
								</div><div class="para">
									Additionally, running an incremental backup will update the backup folder in-place so no old backups will be kept if you choose to enable incremental backups.
